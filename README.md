# 🧬 Cancer Prediction Web Application

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various medical input features. It is built using Python and deployed using the Flask framework, offering a simple and intuitive web interface where users can input tumor data and receive predictions in real-time. The machine learning model used in this project is trained on the widely used Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

## 🧠 Project Description

Cancer prediction is one of the most critical and sensitive tasks in the healthcare domain. Early diagnosis can significantly increase the survival rate, reduce treatment costs, and improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build an intelligent system that aids in the early detection of breast cancer using machine learning techniques.

The backend of the system uses Python with the **scikit-learn** library to train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest). The trained model is saved using **joblib** and deployed through a **Flask** web server. The user interface is built using HTML and allows users to enter values for several tumor-related features (like mean radius, mean texture, etc.). After submitting the form, the model processes the input and returns the result: "Benign" or "Malignant".
